            <strong>Personality</strong> is defined as the characteristic sets of behaviors, cognitions, and emotional
            patterns that evolve from
            biological and environmental factors. While there is no generally agreed upon definition of personality,
            most
            theories focus on motivation and psychological interactions with one's environment. Trait-based personality
            theories, define personality as the traits that predict a person's behavior. On the
            other hand, more behaviorally-based approaches define personality through learning and habits. Nevertheless,
            most
            theories view personality as relatively stable.
            <br />
            <br />
            The four personality types are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Driver
            </li>
            <li>
                Analytical
            </li>
            <li>
                Amiable
            </li>
            <li>
                Expressive
            </li>
